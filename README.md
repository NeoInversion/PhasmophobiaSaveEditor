# PhasmophobiaSaveEditor
C# application to read/parse and edit save data for the game Phasmophobia.

## About
As simply stated above, this is a program that can read and parse Phasmophobia save data. Although the name of the repo is called "PhasmophobiaSave*Editor*", its pretty easy to tell that this isn't the case. The only reason I kept the name was due to 2 reasons: I originally intended to make a save editor out of this, and its easy to do so. However, I ended up having a hard time iterating through the JSON and when I finally did, I felt it was unsatisfactory. It probably would've been better to make a graphical editor for this. If you're looking to edit your Phasmophobia save data, I suggest [Phasmosave](https://phasmosave.com).
